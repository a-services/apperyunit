== Features

link:https://java.com/ru/download/[Java] has to be available on the system to run link:https://apperyunit.app.appery.io[ApperyUnit].

You can run it from shell scripts or just double-click `apperyunit.jar` file from the distribution.

ApperyUnit supports link:appery.io[Appery.io] Server-Code API in read-only mode.
It means that methods of `Collection` object that change data in Appery DB will just print request parameters to console.
More details can be found at <<supported-apis>> section.

=== Command line

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-services/apperyunit/master/images/console-test.png[Console Test]

You can start the utility with `au` shell script.

For example, to run the example of server-code provided in distribution from command-line, one can use:
```
  ./au helloappery.js
```

To run the script in <<echo_mode>>:
```
  ./au helloappery.js echo
```

To run the script in <<test_mode>>:
```
  ./au helloappery.js test
```

More info can be found at <<command_line>> section.

=== GUI


To start the application in GUI mode you can double-click `apperyunit.jar` file or run the script without parameters:

```
  ./au
```

== Usage scenarios

=== Creating new scripts

ApperyUnit can be used to create new Appery.io server-code scripts. Let's suppose we have to implement some new functionality that can probably update the DB in some way. For example, we may need to delete some entity from the database afer some preliminary checks. Or maybe our service should change system status in some way. If we'll create some initial version of the script and then run it in Appery, then there is a good chance that some part of the script will be executed and the other one will not due to some error. After we'll do some fix and run our code again, we can find out that the database entity that we are using for testing was already changed by our script.

With ApperyUnit we have the convenience to save database read requests but actually do not run them. It allows us to modify and run our code till we get some acceptable results. We can also inspect JSON data received from the database. We can even edit JSON files coming from database to achieve the required level of test coverage.

The ability to run the code is particularly important for dynamic programming language like JavaScript that we are using for our server-code scripts, when missing `var` operator for the variable declaration or some forgotten dependency checkbox in Appery.io errors can lead to run-time errors much later, but are not diagnosed at the implementation stage.

When our server-code will be properly tested, we can copy it into Appery.io editor.
With that approach database query results are saved locally. We can consider them to be the input data for our server-code. Query parameters of database update requests can be treated as the expected results of our server-code.

=== Refactoring the existing scripts

With ApperyUnit we can also download the existing versions of the scripts from Appery.io cloud to local folder.
Inputs and outputs of database requests are saved in `fixtures` folder, so running the script in test mode we can ensure that script outputs are not changed and our refactorings didn't break anything.


[[echo_mode]]
== Echo mode

The result of each read request to Appery DB is saved in `fixtures` folder in files named `01_query.json`, `02_query.json`...

When `echo` parameter is specified, then no real requests to Appery DB will be made, but the contents of `01_query.json`, `02_query.json`...  files will be used instead of HTTP requests.

[[test_mode]]
== Test mode

Parameters of each *read* request to Appery DB are saved to files named like `01_query_r.json`, `02_query_r.json`...

Similar, parameters of each *write* request are saved into `01_update_r.json`, `02_update_r.json`...

The result of server-code execution is saved to `script_name.success.json` file.

We assume that our server-code script is going to perform the same read and write requests to Appery DB after the refactoring.

It should be mentioned that write requests to Appery DB are not actually executed by ApperyUnit, so database remains unchanged after the test and we can run it once again with the same results.

When ApperyUnit is started in `test` mode, then read requests to Appery DB are replaced with echoes, and the contents of read and write request parameters
are compared with the saved contents of `nn_query_r.json`, `nn_update_r.json` and `script_name.success.json` files.

== Downloading server-codes to version control

With ApperyUnit GUI one can download server-codes from Appery.io cloud to some local folder.
That folder later can be put under version control to track code changes.

Just select in left-side panel the server-code you want to download, or some folder, or even the root node of the tree
and click *Download* button.

== Documenting API with Swagger

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-services/apperyunit/master/images/swagger.png[Swagger]

One can export the information about REST API from Appery.io cloud in link:https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI] format also known as Swagger.
OpenAPI documentation is some JSON file that can be viewed with link:https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI]

Generating OpenAPI documentation in ApperyUnit is quite simple: just select in left-side panel the server-code or the folder and click *Swagger* button. You will be asked about the name of file to generate, and `swagger.json` file will be generated.

To use it you can:

- Download the latest version of Swagger UI from link:https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[GitHub],
- Place your `swagger.json` into `dist` folder
- In `index.html` replace `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` with just `swagger.json`
- Open `index.html` from some local server. There are plenty of tools around that can provide you local server for testing,
  maybe one of the easiest to use is link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/[Web Server for Chrome]

== Server-code libraries

Libraries for server-code scripts are stored in `libraries` folder.
Dependencies between the scripts can be specified in `dependencies.json` file.

Example:

====
```json
{
  "my_script_1": <1>
     ["my_library_2", "my_library_3"],
  "my_library_2": <2>
     ["my_library_4"]
```
====

<1> Script named `my_script_1` depends on 2 libraries
<2> Libraries can have their own dependencies


[[command_line]]
== Command-line parameters

To try something else rather then simple `helloappery` script you can create some empty folder
and copy 'au.sh' there. Then you should adjust the path to `apperyunit.jar` in this new copy of `au.sh` to point to the
folder where you placed the distribution of ApperyUnit.

You can pass the following parameters to `$AU` utility in `au.sh` file:

script_name.js::
    This is the name of local file with server-code. +
    Required if we are not in downloading mode.

script_name.params::
    Parameters of server-code function can be specified in <<params>> as JSON

echo::
    Run script in echo mode - do not perform real `HTTP GET` requests but use
    `query-NN.json` files from `fixtures` folder.

test::
    Run script in test mode - do not perform real `HTTP GET` requests,
    compare `HTTP POST` requests with
    `update-NN.json` files in `fixtures` folder.


[[params]]
=== `.params` file

- Parameters of server-code function can be specified in `.params` file as JSON. Such files should be placed at `parameters` folder.

- Request headers can be also specified in this JSON as a special `headers` field.

- Request body can be also specified,
  it should be separated from JSON with a line of 4 dashes, like this: `----`.

Example:

====
```json
{
	"param1": "value1", <!--1-->
	"param2": "value2",
	"param3": "value3",

	"headers": { <!--2-->
		"X-Appery-Session-Token": [ "582345afe4b08d1f18d1479b" ]
	},

	"user": { <!--3-->
	    "_id": "582345afe4b08d1f18d14799"
	}

}
----
{ "password":"22" } <!--4-->
```
====

<1> Parameters of server-code function
<2> Request headers
<3> When server-code function is secured, then it has `user` parameter in request
<4> Request body string


[[paramlist]]
=== `.paramlist` file

Each new test scenario requires its own parameters, so we need a set
of `.params` files associated with the single server-code script.
This can be specified with `.paramlist` file.

Each line in `.paramlist` is a name of `.params` file,
or it can be empty, or commented out with `#` character.


[[supported-apis]]
== Supported Server-Code Functions

ApperyUnit is intended to be used to unit-test Appery.io Server-Code functions.
To be able to run tests multiple times the functions of `Collection` object that change data in Appery DB will just print request parameters to console but not actually change anything in DB.

Also, some link:{apperyref}[Appery Server-Code APIs] are not yet supported by ApperyUnit.
